AI Responsibility Practice Project
==================================

Purpose
-------
Hands-on practice for core AI responsibility elements. Each folder is a self-contained module with techniques, exercises, and deliverables.

How to use
----------
1. Start with `00-project-overview` for scope and project standards.
2. Complete each element folder in order, or follow your own track.
3. Capture outputs in each folder's `README.md` under Deliverables.

Standards (apply to all modules)
--------------------------------
- Document assumptions, risks, and limitations.
- Keep datasets small, synthetic, or anonymized.
- Prefer reproducible experiments (fixed seeds, saved configs).
- Include a short model card or evaluation note for each exercise.
